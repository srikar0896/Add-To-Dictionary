# Add-To-Dictionary
<b>This may not work in chrome browse.Please try this in fireFox.Will be devoloping the Chrome version very soon.</b><br>
This is for saving the words and its translations(not yet implemented.Implementing very soon)from webpages 
to personal dictionary by right-clickcing on the word you want to add to the dictionary.
the word will be highlighted indicating the word has been selected and the alert  
and the user will be prompted with a alert box indicating that the word has been saved in the personal dictionary .

In the personal dictionary the user has an option to remove the word.
and can undo it.the user can not undo it once user closes the browser.

# Idea:
Every word in the webpage is kept in span which has specific id and tranlations.these(Id and translation) are used.and when the user right-clicks the word in the web-page the word is saved in the localstorage and if the user want to remove the word
first the copy is saved i the session storage so that if user wants to undo it the word is swapped again.Once the user closes the browser the session storage gets cleared.

Translated words are yet to come this is only for the idea for saving the word however all the schema of the code is most of the part is same.
Any mistakes correct me.
Suggestions are welcome.
